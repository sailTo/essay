# Homework 2 Solution
1. (a) 
	Let $m$ be the number of new scientists, $n$ be the number of teams, $p_{ij}$ be the $(i,j)_{th}$ number in the table. Consider the following algorithm:
		i. Let t scientists be distrbuted to the first k teams, the least probability of failure is $v_k(t)$;
		ii. when a new team is added into consideration, we have: 	
			$v_k(t)=min(p_{kj}\times v_{k-1}(t-j))$ (among all $j$ between 0 and t)
	(b) As $v_k(t)$ is the optimal solution of the first k teams and we went through all possible numbers of team k, there will not be other solutions better.
	(c) In i we need time of o(mn), to calculate ii we need o(m), sothe total time required is $o(mn^2)$.
	(d) The codes required is shown below:
		```
		import numpy as np
def func1(p,m,n):
	v = np.zeros((n,m+1))
	i = np.zeros((n,m+1))
	u = list(range(n))
	for t in range(m+1):
		v[0,t] = p[t,0]
		i[0,t] = t
		for k in range(1,n):
			v[k,t],i[k,t] = min((p[j,k]*v[k-1,t-j], j) for j in range(t+1))
			u[k] = int(i[k,t])
		for k in range(n-2,-1,-1):
			t=t-int(i[k+1,t])
			u[k]=int(i[k,t])
	return v[n-1,m],u
p = np.array([[0.4,0.6,0.8],[0.2,0.4,0.5],[0.15,0.2,0.3],[0.1,0.17,0.25]])
m,n = 3,3
print("The optimal solution is",func1(p,m,n))
		``` 
	(e) The minimal probability of failure is 0.032, for 1,2,0 scientist(s) in team 1,2,3.
2. (a) 
	Let $m$ be the number of allocated budget(unit: $10 million), $n$ be the number of provinces, $p_{ij}$ be the $(i,j)_{th}$ number in the table. Consider the following algorithm:
		i. Let t unit(s) budget be distrbuted to the first k provinces, the least number of delegates is $v_k(t)$;
		ii. when a new province is added into consideration, we have: 	
			$v_k(t)=min(p_{kj}+ v_{k-1}(t-j))$ (among all $j$ between 0 and t)
	(b) As $v_k(t)$ is the optimal solution of the first k provincess and we went through all possible numbers of province k, there will not be other solutions better.
	(c) In i we need time of o(mn), to calculate ii we need o(m), sothe total time required is $o(mn^2)$.
	(d)
		```
		import numpy as np
def func2(p,m,n):
	v = np.zeros((n,m+1))
	i = np.zeros((n,m+1))
	u = list(range(n))
	a,b = np.shape(p)
	p1 = np.zeros((m+1,n))
	p1[:a,:] = p[:,:]
	p=p1
	for t in range(m+1):
		v[0,t] = p[t,0]
		i[0,t] = t
		for k in range(1,n):
			v[k,t],i[k,t] = max((p[j,k]+v[k-1,t-j], j) for j in range(t+1))
			u[k] = int(i[k,t])
		for k in range(n-2,-1,-1):
			t=t-int(i[k+1,t])
			u[k]=int(i[k,t])
	return v[n-1,m],u
p = np.array([[10,4,14,6,39],[30,32,19,12,42],[35,46,46,25,47],[60,52,50,40,50],[95,90,55,52,82]])
m,n = 7,5
print("The optimal solution is",func2(p,m,n))
		``` 
	(e) The maximum of delegates is 218, for $\$4,1,2,0,0\times 10 million$(s) in province 1,2,3,4,5.
